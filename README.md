## My take:

##### I worked with Ben Roaman on this project. He handled most of the javascript and I handled most of the styling. On my part, I'm happy about the responsiveness and overall styling of the website version of our project. However, after checking out the site on my phone, I realize there are some issues. I'm not sure why they appear on my phone but now my browser. I'll hopefully get some solid feedback on how to fix the problem.
